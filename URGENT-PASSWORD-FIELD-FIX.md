# 🚨 URGENT: Password Field Issue

## 🎯 **The Problem:**

You're seeing: **"Please fill in the following required fields: Password (min 6 characters)"**

This means:
- ❌ **Password field is EMPTY** OR
- ❌ **Password is LESS than 6 characters**

---

## ✅ **Quick Fix:**

### **Step 1: Scroll UP to "Basic Information" Section**

The password field is at the **TOP** of the form, in the **"Basic Information"** section.

### **Step 2: Find the Password Field**

Look for:
- **Label:** "Password *"
- **Placeholder:** "Enter at least 6 characters"
- **Location:** Below "Email Address" field

### **Step 3: Enter Your Password**

- **Type at least 6 characters**
- **You'll see a green checkmark** when it's long enough
- **You'll see a red warning** if it's too short

### **Step 4: Check All Fields**

Make sure ALL these are filled:

**Basic Information (TOP):**
- ✅ Full Name
- ✅ Email Address
- ✅ **Password** ← THIS IS THE ONE MISSING!

**Patient Information (BOTTOM):**
- ✅ Age
- ✅ Gender (select Male/Female/Other)
- ✅ CNIC Number
- ✅ Medical History (optional)

## 🔍 **Visual Indicators:**

After my fix, you'll see:
- **Red background** on password field if it's too short

## ⚠️ **Common Issues:**
