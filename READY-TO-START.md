# ✅ Port 4000 is Now Free!

## 🎉 Good News!

I've killed the process that was using port 4000. The port is now **FREE** and ready to use.

## 🚀 Now Start the Backend

### In Your Terminal, Run:

**Step 1 - Navigate to backend:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\faaaaaast\Desktop\foundation\apps\backend
```

**Step 2 - Start the server:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ What You Should See

After running `npm run dev`, you should see:

```
[nodemon] starting 'node src/index.js'
Backend running on http://localhost:4000
```

**When you see this message, the backend is running!** ✅

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Port 4000 is free (done!)
2. ✅ Backend error fixed (rbac import added)
3. ⏳ **Now start the backend** (run `npm run dev`)
4. ⏳ **Keep terminal open**
5. ⏳ **Refresh browser** (F5)
6. ⏳ **Try checkout** - it should work! 🎉

## 📝 Remember

- Keep the terminal window **open** while using the site
- The backend must **stay running** for checkout to work
- If you close the terminal, the backend stops

---

**Run `npm run dev` now and the backend should start successfully!** 🚀
